**Introduction**

WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS) provides a comprehensive solution for identity and access management. One of its prominent features is the management of claims, which are essentially pieces of information about a user, such as their first name, last name, email address, etc. This guide will walk you through the process of managing claims in WSO2 IS.


**1. Understanding Claims**

Before diving into the management of claims, it's essential to understand what claims are and why they are critical:

- **What are Claims?** Claims are attributes related to the user. They can be any information like the user's email, name, role, etc.
  
- **Importance of Claims:** Claims allow for fine-grained control over user attributes and can be used in various scenarios like access control, user profile management, and more.


**2. Accessing the Claim Management Section**

To access and manage claims:

1. Log in to the WSO2 IS management console.
2. Navigate to the `Main` menu, select `Identity`, and then choose `Claims`.


**3. Adding a New Claim Mapping**

Claim mappings allow you to map a claim URI from the Identity Provider to a claim URI in WSO2 IS.

1. In the `Claims` section, click on `Add`.
2. Select a claim dialect from the dropdown or add a new one.
3. Fill in the necessary information, including Claim URI, Display Name, Description, and Mapped Attribute.
4. Click `Add` to save your new claim mapping.


**4. Editing Existing Claim Mappings**

You may need to edit claim mappings to reflect changes in your organization's requirements:

1. Under the `Claims` section, select `List`.
2. Choose the claim mapping you wish to edit.
3. Modify the necessary fields and click `Update` to save changes.


**5. Deleting Claim Mappings**

If a particular claim mapping is no longer required, you can delete it:

1. Go to the `List` under `Claims`.
2. Find the claim mapping you want to remove and click `Delete`.
3. Confirm your action in the popup dialog.


**6. Managing External Claims**

External claims are claims defined for a particular claim dialect. These can be associated with external identity providers.

1. In the `Claims` section, select `External Claims`.
2. Here you can `Add`, `Edit`, or `Delete` external claims similar to claim mappings.


**7. Best Practices for Claim Management**

- Always provide descriptive names for claim URIs to ensure clarity.
  
- Regularly review and clean up unused claim mappings to maintain optimal performance and clarity.
  
- Be cautious when deleting or modifying claim mappings, as these can affect existing configurations and integrations.
